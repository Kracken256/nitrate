*This project is in rapid development. It will not compile into anything useful yet. Check back soon for updates on the projects development.*

Nitrate is a high-level, statically typed, memory-safe, high-performance, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language designed to be safe, expressive, and performant. Nitrate supports runtime reflection, low-level memory access, namespaces, generics, type inference, packed data types, multiple inheritance, operator overloading, coroutines, default initializers, arbitrary precision math, RAII, automatic memory management, inline assembly, compile-time evaluation, and turing complete preprocessing.
Nitrate is especially well-suited for library development, system service development, and general applications. Nitrate is a modern, safe, and expressive alternative to C++ and Rust.
