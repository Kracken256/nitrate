# Quix Compiler

*Project is in rapid development. It will not compile to anything useful yet.*

QUIX is a high-level, statically typed, memory-safe\*, garbage-collected\*, high-performance, object-oriented, general-purpose systems programming language designed to be safe, expressive, and performant. QUIX supports runtime reflection, low-level memory access, namespaces, generics, type inference, packed data types, classes, operator overloading, coroutines, default initializers, arbitrary precision math, RAII, automatic memory management, and metaprogramming.
QUIX is especially well-suited for library development, game development, and systems programming. QUIX is designed to be a modern, safe, and expressive alternative to C++ and Rust.

## Technical Detail

### General Architecture

---

The QUIX Compiler has a reasonably standard architecture, with a complex preprocessor that is essentially an LUA interpreter, an optimizer, and the LLVM backend. Two custom IRs are used in this compiler's middle end to facilitate the correct and comprehendible translation of the high-level language into native binary code. The compiler is written entirely in "modern" C++ and is designed to be fast, efficient, easy to maintain, and extend.

### Preprocessor Engine Architecture

---

Some programming languages like Rust have extremely complex macro systems that can feel more like writing theoretical computer science papers than writing helpful code. QUIX has the most potent macro systems of any programming language. QUIX accomplishes this by just embedding a complete LUA interpreter into the preprocessor. You can write `metastatic` functions that may take in arguments and return values that will be recursively preprocessed until there are no more macros to expand. This recursion enables the creation of extraordinarily powerful custom constructs that are *readable*, *understandable*, and *compiler-time performant*. The LUA interpreter context exists for the entire duration of the preprocessor, which is effectively the entire compilation unit, meaning the state is preserved between macros. How hard would it be if you wanted to write a macro in Rust that would do a SHA-3 cryptographic hash at compile time? In QUIX, simply use LUA to implement the standard algorithm as you would in regular programs and then call your macro like `@sha3_256("You data to hash")` which may occur anywhere in your code (as it applies before parsing). QUIX just made elegant macros a solved problem. Also, macros are loosely (optionally) type-checked on input and output, which catches wierd issues early.

## Building

**These notes are pending cross-distribution testing.**

Build on Debian systems:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git
cd ~/Downloads
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Kracken256/quix.git
cd quix

# Install dependencies
# libpolly-14-dev is not necessary in all distributions. If it does not exist in your package manager, try building without it.
# If libPolly will be in issue in your build it will manifest as a linker error.

sudo apt install -y clang cmake make llvm-14 upx libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libzstd-dev libclang-common-14-dev rapidjson-dev libdeflate-dev libreadline-dev libcurlpp-dev libclang-dev libclang-cpp-dev nlohmann-json3-dev libpolly-14-dev

# Build the toolchain in release mode
cmake -S . -B .build/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./build -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++
cmake --build .build/release -j$(nproc)
cmake --install .build/release

## Diagnostic Reporting

The following is an example of an error message generated by the Quix compiler:
In reality, the error message would be colorized.

```plaintext
examples/test.q:3:9-?:?: error: ptree-invalid
 ╔ This function is expected to return in all possible branches. Why is your 
 ╚ function failing to do so?

 ╔═ Code Intelligence:
 ╠═ Make sure you have a return statement when you need one.
 ╠═ If you are using a loop and avoiding a return, ensure that it is knowable 
 ║   that the loop will always terminate.
 ╠═ If you are optimizing, make sure it is knowable that that a particular 
 ║   branch is impossible to avoid this error.
