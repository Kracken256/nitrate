# Contributor Code of Conduct

**Be respectful, understanding, and amicable to all contributors.**

### General guidelines of conduct:
- Avoid irrelevant, controversial political discussions.
- Don't discriminate against others based on generally protected characteristics, regardless of your ideology.
- Polite discussions are encouraged. Outrageously rude or overly slanderous remarks may result in a ban.
- Behave maturely because I won't supervise this contributor's conduct policy like a police state as if it is a material objective duty of the project's development.
- Don't plagiarize other people's ideas, especially in the domain of technology pertinent to this project.
